# Arcade Classics
This is the official GitHub repository for my Arcade Classics game, made for the Pokitto game console. PLEASE NOTE: The only files in this repository I lay claim to are main.cpp, textures.h, the entire BMPs folder, and MENU.SND. The rest of the files are part of the Pokitto Simulator; you can find the Pokitto website at pokitto.com.
# How To Use
1. Install Code::Blocks at codeblocks.org.
2. Download this repository.
3. Start up Code::Blocks and open Pokitto_sim.cbp in the POKITTO_SIM folder.
4. If the active build target is not Game, switch it to Game and click "Recompile."
5. If you change anything, press "Build and Run" to run the game; otherwise, click "Run."
