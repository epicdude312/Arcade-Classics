# Arcade Classics
This is the official GitHub repository for my Arcade Classics game, made for the Pokitto game console. PLEASE NOTE: The only files in this repository I lay claim to are main.cpp, textures.h, the entire BMPs folder, and MENU.SND. The rest of the files are part of the Pokitto Simulator; you can find the Pokitto website at pokitto.com.
# How To Use
1. Install Code::Blocks at codeblocks.org.
2. Download this repository.
3. Start up Code::Blocks and open Pokitto_sim.cbp in the POKITTO_SIM folder.
4. If the active build target is not Game, switch it to Game and click "Recompile."
5. If you change anything, press "Build and Run" to run the game; otherwise, click "Run."
# Troubleshooting
If you're having problems with colors not rendering correctly: check your graphics libraries. They may not be the same as mine...
If you're having any other issues, please notify me! I'm happy to help.
# Helping Contribute
If you've got a new game you'd like me to add, please post it on the Pokitto forum post (which I'm assuming you all came from). I'll then let you add it to the repo, and give you credit.
# Credits
NOTE: All games belong to their original owners. I do not mean to infringe on any copyrights; this project served as a way to teach me C++ and the Pokitto API. Also, Pokitto is made by Jonne Valola, not me; as I said above, make sure to check out pokitto.com! It's awesome, and I think a lot of retro gamers will enjoy it.
Pong, Breakout, Snake, and Stacker were coded 100% by epicdude312 (me).
